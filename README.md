Tilt Tiltover

This project is a Java-based implementation of two games, Tilt and Tipover, developed as a college term project at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The objective was to create a shared solver for both games, with display options via a graphical user interface (GUI) and a plain text user interface (PTUI), both of which I developed. As a pre-project activity, we also implemented solvers for classic puzzles such as the Clock Puzzle and the Water Jug Puzzle from Die Hard, which helped establish foundational problem-solving skills.

About
Tilt Tiltover is a two-in-one game application that includes:

Tilt: A game where players tilt a board to guide pieces to target positions.
Tipover: A game that involves tipping stacks of crates to form connected paths.
The games share a common solver that uses a unified logic framework to handle both games, demonstrating modular programming and adaptability.
(Warning: This project was cloned because it was under another organization group (for RIT) so all commits may not be there.)

Pre-Project Activities

To prepare for the main project, we developed solvers for:

Clock Puzzle: Calculates the shortest sequence to set a clock to a specified time.
Water Jug Puzzle: Solves the problem of measuring an exact amount of water using two jugs with different capacities.
These exercises helped us build problem-solving techniques that were crucial for creating an adaptable solver.

Features

Tilt Game: Interactive mechanics to tilt pieces across the board.
Tipover Game: Allows players to tip crates and create pathways.
Common Solver: A shared algorithm that adapts to both games.
Dual Interface Options:
GUI: A graphical interface for intuitive gameplay.
PTUI: A console-based interface for a simpler, text-only interaction.

Technologies
Java

Installation
Clone the repository:
1. Copy code
2. git clone https://github.com/JustxJiang/Tilt-Tipover.git
3. Open the project in a Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse). VS Code works too!
4. Build and run the project, selecting either GUI or PTUI mode to launch the game.
(Or download the zip file)

Usage
Choose to start the game in either GUI or PTUI mode.
Select a game (Tilt or Tipover) or try out the pre-project puzzles.
In PTUI, follow the prompts; in GUI, use interactive controls to play.
Use the solver to receive hints or auto-complete the game.
Collaboration and Challenges
This project was a collaboration with awd8767. Working as a team, we encountered obstacles around:

Code Integration: 
- Combining each other's code required extensive testing and coordination to ensure the solver worked seamlessly across both games.
- We sometimes ran into small problems that hindered project progress but we overcame them in the end. 
- Communication and Planning: Scheduling and aligning our goals was challenging at times, but we overcame it through regular check-ins and clear task delegation.
- Working through these challenges strengthened our collaboration skills, enhanced our communication and problem-solving abilities, and taught us the value of team compromise in a project setting.

Lessons Learned
- Developed skills in Java GUI programming and PTUI development.
- Enhanced problem-solving techniques through pre-project puzzles and applying them to a common solver.
- Gained experience in teamwork, code integration, and the importance of clear communication and flexibility in collaborative projects.
